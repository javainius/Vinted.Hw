- To launch the dotnet application you will need to navigate to Vinted.Hw\Vinted.Hw.API and execute: "dotnet run" or you can do it by using VisualStudio IDE. 
- To run tests: navigate to Vinted.Hw\Vinted.Hw.UnitTests and execute "dotnet test"

Things to note:
- I used LINQ which is not additional but built in C# library.
- I have decided to do a little more for this task but unexpectedly I had a really busy weak so I have written tests only for the ParsingClass and haven't made a console application which would have used Services layer.
- Haven't made a propper exception throwing and handling. An exception handling wrapper should wrap the services layer and then in the middle ware should be done a propper request exception structure which would be returned back to a user.
- By executing the same request with the same file, each time the Transactions.json file should be deleted or removed the data in it
